## 🎯 Priority 1: Immediate Improvements (Next Session)

### AI Behavior Enhancement
**Goal**: Make AI opponents more challenging and realistic

#### Implementation:
```javascript
// Enhanced AI decision making
const AI_IMPROVEMENTS = {
    // Smarter targeting
    targetPrioritization: {
        lowHealth: 2.0,      // Priority multiplier for low health enemies
        closeRange: 1.5,     // Priority for nearby enemies
        hasAbility: 1.3      // Priority for enemies with abilities ready
    },
    
    // Better positioning
    positioning: {
        idealRange: botClass.preferredRange,
        retreatThreshold: 0.3,  // Retreat when below 30% health
        coverUsage: true        // Use arena obstacles for cover
    },
    
    // Ability usage
    abilityUsage: {
        defensive: health < 0.5,  // Use defensive abilities when hurt
        offensive: enemyHealth < 0.3,  // Use offensive when enemy is low
        strategic: nearbyEnemies > 1   // Use AoE abilities vs groups
    }
};
